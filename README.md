## Task 1 : Implement TestNG annotations

This Java program uses **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG** to automate tests on the **SauceDemo** website using **Microsoft Edge**. It opens the website, logs in with a test account, and adds a product to the cart. The code includes **explicit waits** for synchronization and **assertions** to verify expected outcomes.

## Task 3 - Implement Extent Report and Screenshots
This Java program uses **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and **Extent Reports** to automate testing on **YouTube** using **Microsoft Edge**. It performs two actions: opening YouTube and searching for "Rasputin Dance." Screenshots are captured at each step and saved in the "reports/screenshots" folder. The program generates an HTML report with logs and screenshots using **Extent Reports** to track test results.
